# Hey! I’m Snehal  👋

**Data Analyst • Aspiring Product Manager**
I aim to turn user insights into successful products that help provide real value to the customers. 

## About me

I focus on product-driven data science: understanding user behavior, extracting actionable insights, and building analytics & ML solutions that inform product decisions. I enjoy working end-to-end across the data lifecycle — from collecting and cleaning raw data, to building models and uncovering patterns, and finally translating those insights into actionable recommendations that help stakeholders make informed and impactful decisions.
